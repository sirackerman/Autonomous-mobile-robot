# mobile_robot_ORBSLAM3
This is repository of a robotixc project I'm working on. I'm designing a mobile robot to run autonomously using ORBSLAM3 with ROS and two path planning algorithms for obstacle avoidance.
It' s a work in progress. I will update the readme file once it's completed and can be used by anyone.
