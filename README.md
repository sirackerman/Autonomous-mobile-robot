# mobile_robot_ORBSLAM3
This is a work in progress. I will update the readme file once it's completed and can be used by anyone. I'm designing a mobile robot to run autonomously using ORBSLAM3 with ROS and two path planning algorithms for obstacle avoidance. The plan is to have a working program then test it on a real mobile robot.
Working in Ubuntu 18.08 using ROS Melodic.
